            <p>
                Participation in Service Delivery INTRODUCTION Service delivery is an interactive and dynamic process
                which involves participation between the service organization, the service provider and the customer.
                According to Lovelock and Young (1979), customer participation can raise organizational productivity and
                efficiency and improve service performance. The principle behind this notion is that customers can
                fulfill some of the employees current functions thereby reducing the service providers.
